# TiNSGIF

An Appcelerator Titanium module for iOS to create animated GIFs from videos based on [NSRare/NSGIF](https://github.com/NSRare/NSGIF) with modifications and memory leak fixes on my fork https://github.com/kosso/NSGIF.


See the full test app (TiNSGIFTest) in the examples folder.

[example](https://github.com/kosso/TiNSGIF/blob/master/example.gif "TiNSGIF example")

This module was built against Titanium SDK v.4.1.1.v20150802200935.  To build it yourself you might need to edit the `manifest` file and `titanium.xcconfig` to suit your local Titanium installation locations.
